**TODO**:

- [ ] Figure out what to do


**DESIGN**:

1. What do we want?

* We want a board (without a board, we can't play), we want to split it in little squares.
* We want a way to interact with the board (I/O: input/output, e.g you click on a box (input is mouse event), box turns green (render html))
* We want to have numbers on the board (draw numbers on board) - flag variable
* After we put a number on the board, we want to know if position is good.
* We want to track score, or time, or something like that. 


2. Do we have any examples? (links)
